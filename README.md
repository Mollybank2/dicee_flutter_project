🎲 Dicee App

A simple Flutter app that displays dice and updates their values when tapped.

What I Learned
	•	Importing Dart libraries (dart:math)
	•	Using variables and generating random numbers
	•	Writing functions to store logic and reuse them later for cleaner code
	•	Handling user interactions with tap gestures
	•	Updating the UI using setState()
	•	Understanding Stateless vs Stateful widgets and how state controls UI changes

Built as part of my Flutter learning journey
